    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>I specialize in installing dash cams, radar detectors, speakers, radios, subwoofers, backup cameras, and more. If you're looking for a specific service, feel free to ask—I’m happy to provide more details!</p>
    <p>Right now, I offer the services listed above, but I plan to add more over time. I have some type of experience working on cars, and all installations come with a personal warranty. If you ever have any issues or concerns, just reach out (you can find my contact info on the Contact tab), and I’ll make sure everything is taken care of.</p>
    <p>I offer both on-site and mobile installations. You can come to me, or I can come to you. Mobile service prices vary based on location, and any additional costs will be listed in the Services tab. If you're unsure about pricing for your location, just contact me, and I'll let you know.</p>
    <p>Let me know how I can help!</p>
